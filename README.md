# Cup-Ball-Game
Attempt to mimic the behavior of a cup and ball game where the user has to guess the position of the ball once. 

The cup and ball game is a 2D representation of the real-world game where a ball is placed underneath the cup, and the magician moves it around quickly and request the individual to guess the position of the ball. 

This game mimics this behaviour, except the user has to guess both the row and column number. If the user gets it wrong, then it will display the correct answer and again randomize the ball's position so the position of the ball is different for every game. On the otherhand, if the user guesses the correct answer. It will congratulate the user and state the number of tries it took. 

[['#', '#', '#', '#'], ['#', '#', '#', '#'], ['#', '#', '#', '#']]  Do you know where the ball is positioned? Play the game and find out!
